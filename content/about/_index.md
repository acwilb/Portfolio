Hi, I'm Alison! I recently graduated from UCLA, where I studied Statistics and Data Science. I enjoy using my knowledge of statistical analysis and machine learning to take deep dives into various aspects of entertainment, such as music, filmmaking, and television.

![This is me][1]

Outside of my academic experience, I most recently worked in social media marketing, where I accumulated over 50 million views for the startup I worked with. During my time in this role, my content brought an overnight spike of >230k new users to the target platform.

Before my time at UCLA, I worked in retail and additionally partook in a mentorship program at United Talent Agency in their Beverly Hills headquarters (where my interest in entertainment **_really_** took off). In my free time, I enjoy going on road trips, exploring hiking trails, listening to music, and baking!
