![Hulu Dashboard](/img/dashboards/hulu.png)

Here is a preview of the interactive dashboard, which used a 2017 dataset of TV shows available on the streaming platform.

At the top of the dashboard, the user can select the title they would like to explore. The dashboard then displays data such as the title's rating, genre, company, release year, and description.

Below this section of the dashboard is the overall analysis of the dataset. Visualizations include the **Distribution of Top Studios** available on Hulu (based on frequncy of available titles), **Top Genres** on the platform, **Distribution of Ratings** based on the frequency of available shows, and **Density of Shows Added by Year** over time on Hulu.
