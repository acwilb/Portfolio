Here is a preview of the interactive dashboard, which used a 2019 dataset of TV shows and movies available on the streaming platform.

At the top of the dashboard, the user can select the type of media they are interested in exploring (Movie or TV Show), and the title they would like to explore. The dashboard then displays data such as the title's duration, genre, rating, release year, and desciption.

Below this section of the dashboard is the overall analysis of the dataset. Visualizations include the **Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows** on Netlflix, a **Heatmap of Regions with the Most Titles Available** on Netflix, the **Distribution of Ratings** for titles available on Netflix, the **Top 10 Genres** available on Netflix (based on frequency), the **Density of Total Titles by Year** over time on Netflix, and the **Top 10 Directors** on Netflix (based on frequency of available titles).
